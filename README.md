# Sort-Algorithms

You can do what you want with it.
I support open source, so yeah.
I uploaded this library on the go since I'm still learning different sorting algorithms.
So yeah, I will upload updated libraries in the future.

PS: If you're in my sort algorithms repository and noticr that there are no folders then that means i deleted them to add a newer versions of my codes
